***Ideas:***  
1. **Golf Stat Tracker:**  
   - Take scores, # of GIR, FIR, putts, drops etc...
     - *Consider adding a feature of adding scores using a hole-by-hole method that way you can create a counter for each type of score (ex: 79 total birdies). Also create a pi-graph of all the types of scores (eagle or better, birdie, par, bogey, double bogey, triple bogey or worse)*
   - Calculate handicap based off of GHIN equation.
2. **Library Book Checkout System:**  
   - Store books in a hash table (ISBN â†’ Book info). Track which users checked out which books (queue or map). Feature: waitlist system (queue) for when all copies are checked out. Stretch goal: support book searches by title/author with BST or trie.
3. **Stock-Market Simulation:**  
   - Use a priority queue (min/max heap) for buy/sell orders. Simulate trades as orders come in. Features: Match buy/sell orders based on price priority. Print transaction log. Stretch goal: add statistics (average price, volume, etc.).
4. **Tournament Bracket Manager:**  
   - Use a binary tree structure. Input: list of players. Randomly assign first round. Traverse tree to update winners and print bracket. Stretch goal: double-elimination style using queues/stacks.
